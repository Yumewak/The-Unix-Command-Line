# The Unix Command Line
## Understanding the command line
```
Kerne: If O.S is a pistacho the kernel is the nut
Shell: The user interface

GUI: Graphical user interface (shell) like the explorer

Command line interface
Bash: Bourne Again Shell, is a CLI or a Command Line Interpreter, provide speed and control

First commands:
mkdir: make a new folder (example: mkdir Music)
ls -a: Search for created folders inside the directory
```

## Command Line Techniques and directory navigation
```
ls: List
Lists all the items inside a particular directory

cd: Change Directory
Helps to directory navigation, you can use Tab to auto-complete path "cd Doc (+Tab) = cd Documents/"
cd ~: Go back to root

You can write the entire path to go directly in to the folder you want
cd /Document/web/edx

Up and Down arrows : Navigate thorugh the last commands

cd (Drag and drop) : Navigate to a deep directory without type out the entire path

cd .. : Go backwards in the directory path one level

Left and Right arrows or press alt and use mouse click: Edit the command at some point in the middle

control + A: Go to the beginning of the line
control + E: Go to the end of the line
control + V: clear your entire line
```
